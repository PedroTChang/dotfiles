# Why
My Neovim config was so bloated...and I didn't even know what was installed.

In my desire to do things fast. I am going backwards.

LazyVim is a Neovim setup powered by ðŸ’¤ lazy.nvim to make it easy to customize and extend your config.

I finally realized that [LazyVim.org](https://www.lazyvim.org/) is different than [Lazy.Folke.io](https://lazy.folke.io/).

The creator of LazyVim though, is Folke. The `.org` though, is not his design.

It is a larger config, with a bunch of different plugins.

So many, in fact, that I have no idea *what* is being installed.

## Philosophy

I am had a journey for about a year being a minimalist.

I read a book "Goodbye Things" by [Fumio Sasaki](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15267855.Fumio_Sasaki), which changed my perspective on things.

It was a section where there was, not the author, someone who put all their possessions inside storage, and day by day, they took out 1 item they needed.

I think that is a great way to look at things, if it is unused, it's possesing you!

Therefore, with that philosophy, I decided to redo my Neovim config, and make it extremely lightweight, and lean.

This is going to be a bespoke setup for myself, so if you do use it, just make note that it may not work as intended.
